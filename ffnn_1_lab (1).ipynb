This is a rather shallow network, and the next step is to extend it to a deep network that can handle any number of layers.\n","\n","To handle an arbitrary number of layers, switch to taking a 3-dimensional array for the layer weights -- now the first index will specify which layer the remaing 2-dimension subarray is associated with (e.g. `W[2]` would be the 2-d array of weights for the connections from layer 2 to layer 3). Similary, add another dimension to the biases to specify the layer, making $b$ a 2-dimensional array.\n","\n","Here you will probably need to use a for loop to iterate through the layers. You can continue to use the sigmoid activation function for all layers."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"0D8I7im509tV","colab_type":"code","colab":{},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1599613904167,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":492,"user":{"displayName":"Ziyang Zhang","photoUrl":"","userId":"15658344838790008967"}}},"source":["def deep_nn(X, W, b, f_hidden, f_output):\n","  '''\n","  forward pass for a deep neural net with an arbitrary number of layers\n","\n","  parameters\n","  ----------\n","  X (2d array):     input vectors\n","  W (3d array):     weight matrices -- W[layer, input, neuron]\n","  b (2d array):     biase vectors -- b[layer, neuron]\n","  '''\n","  for i in range(W.shape[0]):\n","    X = nn_layer(X, W[i], b[i])\n","\n","  return X"],"execution_count":26,"outputs":[]}]}
